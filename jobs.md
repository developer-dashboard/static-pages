* [Senior Manager of Marketing Operations](https://www.npmjs.com/marketing-bd-sales#senior-marketing-operations-manager)

Even if none of those is what you're interested in, if you would like to work with us and have skills you think would be helpful, please send an email with evidence of your experience (like your resume, or links to LinkedIn/GitHub/wherever) to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com).

We’d like to hear from you.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Frank+H+Ogawa+Plaza/@37.805544,-122.2720659,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f80b1a2db786f:0x4685356d4acb43ef) are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
