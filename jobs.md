## www Engineer

The site you're looking at right now has come a long way. In the last 10 months our hard-working www team has re-written it into [a whole new codebase](https://github.com/npm/newww), refactoring old code, implementing a brilliant new design, and adding a bunch of new features that are going to be released annnnny moment now in support of [private modules](/private-modules). 

We get well over 5MM page views every month, and we're just getting started. The next 12 months will see us building features that have long been [on our roadmap](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this) like curation tools, package ecosystems, ever-improving search, interactive tutorials for new users, better package management, and access control systems for users, organizations and teams.

As you can see, there's a lot to do, and we're going to need a lot of help to do it. You'll be joining our existing team of two www engineers, which will be growing to a total of five plus a full-time designer in 2015. More people means more focus, and juicier features for you to work on.

As a www engineer, you'll be focusing less on the visual aspects of the site and more on its functionality. You'll be working closely with the registry team to define and integrate new APIs in order to implement new user-facing features, while always keeping in mind the principles of performance, scalability and security.

We're looking for somebody who is experienced enough to have a strong sense of best practices and good architectural instincts, to keep the code base clean and maintainable as our feature set continues to expand. Your code will be open source, so you'll get help from the community, as well as a voice in establishing the best practices for modern web development in node.js.

We prefer candidates who are local to our offices in downtown Oakland, California, but are open to remote work for the right candidate. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, though we can transfer existing H1-Bs, and TN-1s for Canadians.


## Support Tech

npm has more than 3 million users worldwide and that number is growing fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers.

And every day, tens of thousands of brand new users show up.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with better than 99.999% uptime, and by answering each of the tweets, emails, and GitHub issues that our users send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users.  "npm loves you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value.

To that end, we're building out a dedicated support team.  The right person for this job combines empathy and communication skills with a passion for solving technical problems.  Experience with Open Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required.

Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of every member of the engineering team (who are the ones currently doing all these things).

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.  You'll be the first full-time member of this team, but not the last.

You'll report directly to Isaac, CEO and inventor of npm, and a former front-line support tech himself.  You'll be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options.  We are not accepting remote candidates for this role.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Frank+H+Ogawa+Plaza/@37.805544,-122.2720659,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f80b1a2db786f:0x4685356d4acb43ef) are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
