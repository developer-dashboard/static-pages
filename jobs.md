## UX/UI designer

We have a website. It's really big, and quite pretty these days. Under the hood, we rebuilt it completely, launching that new version back in April, when we introduced private modules. But we're just getting started.

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) gets a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM pageviews, and has grown 200% in the last 12 months. People use it to find new modules, to read the documentation, and now they use it to manage their private modules as well.

In the near future we're going to launch our Organizations feature, and our users will be able to manage teams and package permissions from the website too. Soon after that we're going to be adding a bunch of new features to make it faster and easier to find the right package, by adding [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, both of which will give us the new data we need to enhance the all-important search experience.

These are chunky, challenging features, and we need somebody to help us design the best experience for our users. npm's philosophy is to reduce friction, so a user experience that is minimal and gets out of their way, with smart defaults and simple, obvious workflows, is what we need.

We know that UX and UI are different skill sets and different jobs, so we know we're asking for a lot when we say we want both, and all other things being equal we will lean towards people who are stronger UX designers, and have good product ideas.

We are *not* asking you to also be a developer: while you will be part of the engineering organization — because we believe design and engineering should collaborate closely — engineering skills are not a requirement of this job. If you like coding you are welcome to do it, but if you don't you can leave the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the rest of the engineering team. However, we are a tool for developers, so somebody who understands developers and has worked on technical products before is going to be at an advantage.

This position will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA, and we are not looking for remote candidates for this position.


## team lead, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All these plans require we grow the www team from its current size of two to five people in 2015, and we want the first of those hires to be a senior engineer, capable of taking responsibility for the architecture of the site and leading the team.

That means an engineer with experience working on big projects, able to make tricky architectural decisions and then successfully communicate and delegate the implementation. We want somebody who also has the inclination to handle the task juggling and messy human parts of keeping a group of smart, motivated individuals happy and productive. 

We know that's not every engineer's idea of a good time. If this isn't what you want, we're hiring two other engineers. But if you're worried that you're not experienced enough, we encourage you to apply -- let us make that call. The worst that can happen is that we'll hire you for one of the other positions.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

Because of the amount of face time involved in representing the team, we are not accepting remote applicants for this role. This will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA.


## frontend engineer, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All of this adds up to a ton of website that needs to get built, and this role will emphasize front-end skills: robust client-side JavaScript, beautiful CSS, and elegant markup. Our site has only a limited amount of "rich" functionality right now, and you'll be responsible for greatly expanding and improving that, with a lot of say in how it gets built.

We don't need you to be familiar with any specific client-side JS or CSS framework, and in fact we'd prefer the kind of pragmatic, experienced developer who has a bunch of tools in their belt and can thoughtfully select the right one for the job.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

We have a strong preference for candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, CA, but we are accepting exceptional remote candidates who have a proven track record of successful remote work.


## backend engineer, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All of this stuff relies on smart, well-designed APIs that integrate easily with our front-end code. As a backend engineer on the www team, you'll serve as the bridge between the registry and www teams, working in both code bases. You'll extend existing APIs to tackle new needs, add endpoints to increase efficiency, and spin up whole new services to provide the features that the site is going to need.

We're not looking for a shopping list of languages and technologies. We're looking for people who are smart and get stuff done, who have a track record of understanding complicated problems and solving them. For this role in particular, it'll be important that you are a strong communicator and big-picture thinker, capable of weaving teams and systems together to achieve your goals. You probably won't be writing HTML and CSS, but it's a good idea if you care about websites.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

We have a strong preference for candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, CA, but we are accepting exceptional remote candidates who have a proven track record of successful remote work.

We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.
