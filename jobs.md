  <h2>npm is hiring</h2>
</hgroup>

We are currently accepting applications for two [support techs](#support-tech), a [lead product designer](#lead-product-designer), and a [summer intern](#internship). Even if that's not what you have in mind, if you would like to work with us and have skills you think would be helpful, please send an email with evidence of your experience (like your resume, or links to LinkedIn/GitHub/wherever) to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com).

We’d like to hear from you.

## Support Tech

npm has more than 3 million users worldwide and that number is growing
fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems
administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots,
to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of
front-end developers.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction.  We do it by
building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by
maintaining a registry with better than 99.999% uptime, and by
answering each of the tweets, emails, and GitHub issues that our users
send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users.  "npm loves
you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value.  Users
frequently report our responsive and friendly support team as a key
reason why they love our products.

### is this you?

The right people for this job combine empathy and communication skills
with a passion for solving technical problems.  Experience with Open
Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required.

Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding
common questions, building up FAQs, on-boarding new customers, and
solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of
every member of the engineering team.

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with
every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company
insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.

Sometimes, this job is hard, because people are not always nice.  You'll be helping to keep the npm community a safe and friendly place, with the technical and emotional support of the entire company, and the gratitude of countless developers who participate in the npm ecosystem.

We're opening two roles for new Support Techs.  You'll
be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and
stock options.  We are not accepting remote candidates for this role.


## Lead Product Designer

npm is the largest module repository in the world, built to help developers connect and share JavaScript code. Since its inception in 2009, our passionate community has shared more than 230,000 modules, and in the last week alone, they’ve downloaded these almost a billion times.

We also are a key part of the inner-source movement, which takes lessons learned in developing open source software and applies them to help companies develop software internally.

### about this role

We are incredibly proud of our community and we’re looking for a lead product designer who can help us understand and better meet their needs.

As Lead Product Designer, you will help us understand the diverse needs of our different user types — from the hack school grad dabbling in his first open source project to the seasoned programmer looking for the right tools for her company. You will then advocate for our users while collaborating with our engineering, marketing, product, and leadership teams.

Your role will range from product thinking, to interaction, to pixel-perfect detailed mockups.

* You are comfortable working openly, sharing works in progress, and explaining your thought process.
* You build expressive prototypes, whether they are in Axure, InVision, or HTML/CSS/JS. Your choice of tools doesn’t matter. We care that you are able to communicate detail in transitions, animations, and complex interactions.
* You will expand our existing brand language and show us how to use it to create compelling components and user flows.
* You have experience presenting your work to a team in a crit-based environment, and the humility to look objectively at ways to improve it.
* You are comfortable running user tests to validate design decisions. Whether you use online surveys, site data, or qualitative interviews, you can back up complex decisions that need the additional user insight.
* You don’t have to be a programmer, but you love designing for developers and could get into CLI workflows.
* You appreciate our slightly quirky aesthetic and can see ways to run with it.

This position will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA, and we are not looking for remote candidates for this position.



## Internship

If you're currently in full-time undergraduate education (class of 2017 or 2018) and looking for a summer internship with an open-source project that can also pay you, we are happy to say that we can offer you a place at npm, Inc. in partnership with our investors, as part of the [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/) program.

We are looking primarily for enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity, but any experience with JavaScript and especially Node.js is obviously a big advantage.

You will be working on the open-source npm project itself, so your work will be code-reviewed by the same people who run the project, your commits will immediately benefit tens of thousands of active users, and will also be publicly verifiable by future employers.

Our first intern, [Faiq](https://twitter.com/faiqus), wrote about [what he learned](http://www.trueventurestec.som/2014/06/26/some-useful-info-for-tech-interns/) on TEC's blog and also had this to say:

> Imagine working at a place with some of the best and kindest engineers, getting paid to write open source code, and being immersed in one of the most diverse developer communities ever. It sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? When you get a chance to work at npm, you'll be doing exactly that. Day to day, you'll get to work on challenging problems that push your limits as an engineer. You'll run into problems that'll seem impossible at first, but by the end of your internship will seem like a piece of cake! This internship is one of the most unique opportunites you'll get, so definitely give it a shot and apply!

Faiq worked on our website and search. Even after leaving npm, Faiq continues to be involved and has even [committed to npm core](https://github.com/npm/npm/commits/master?author=faiq). You can expect a range of opportunities depending on your interests.

If you are interested, please send a brief email introducing yourself as well as a PDF or Google doc of your resume to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com) and include the word "internship" in your subject line. The internship is based in our uptown Oakland, California office. You must be part of the graduating class of 2017 or 2018 and legally able to work in the United States; we are not currently able to sponsor visa applications.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1999+Harrison+St,+Oakland,+CA+94612/@37.8077715,-122.2673374,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f874d2c997df9:0x8afe4a3bcea14bc3) are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
