We are currently looking for a [Senior Marketing Manager](#senior-marketing-manager) 

If you would like to work with us and have skills you think would be helpful, please send an email with evidence of your experience (like your resume, or links to LinkedIn/GitHub/wherever) to [hiring@npmjs.com](mailto:hiring@npmjs.com).

We’d like to hear from you.

## Senior Marketing Manager

The npm service supports a massive community of over 2 million developers who use our platform to share and reuse Javascript code.  Our users depend on npm to help them build solutions for thousands of the largest companies in the world.   Best of all, npm is growing exponentially.   

npm, Inc is looking for a marketing operations expert to help the company build a high-velocity, low-touch marketing and self-service sales engine.   

We are looking for someone who will take responsibility for setting-up and managing a suite of marketing automation tools such as Hubspot, Kissmetrics and Google Analytics.   

Your responsibilities will include SEO and SEM.  Because npm already has over 2 million open source users, you’ll likely focus most of your attention on the experience of users as they learn about and then hopefully purchase our privacy and security solutions.   We are very interested in learning how to optimize that experience.  What drip campaigns work?   What questions are customers asking?  Where are they getting confused?   How can we improve the product, the web site, documentation or the communications we send customers to help improve adoption?

You’ll work with many parts of the organization, including Developer Relations, Support, the Sales team and provide customer and data based feedback and input to Product and Engineering.

We are looking for someone who is data driven, and is happy A/B testing ideas until the best approach is found.

Because npm is small and growing start-up, we are looking for someone who happy to step in and lend a hand in a wide range of projects, including helping to coordinate participation in events and providing marketing support for some of our large partnerships.

Finally, we are looking for someone who wants to grow with our company.   We have the millions of passionate users and the beginnings of a solid customer base.   This is a chance to have a direct and immediate impact.

If you are interested, please email us at [hiring@npmjs.com](mailto:hiring@npmjs.com)


 
#### Location.

Our offices are located in downtown Oakland, California, near BART.  This position requires someone who works from our offices daily.

## About npm, Inc.
npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
