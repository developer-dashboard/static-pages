For large customers, the position will involve building and maintaining executive level relationships across customer organizations and business units, and navigating procurement processes typical of of $100K+ purchases.

You will be comfortable with a disciplined approach to sales, including automated sales tools and maintaining an accurate and up to date information within our CRM.   We are a very data driven company and focus on pipeline progress and metrics around promptness of sales responses and customer satisfaction.

#### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with 5+ years of demonstrated successful Enterprise Software or SaaS sales experience.  Ideally, you will also have startup experience and enough technical knowledge to understand what developers do and how npm can help them.

## About npm, Inc.
npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
