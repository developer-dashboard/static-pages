<h1>npm Private Modules</h1>  
</hgroup>

When you pay for private modules, you can:

- Host as many private packages as you want
- Give read access or read-write access for those packages to any other paid user
- Install and use any packages that other paid users have given you read access to
- Collaborate on any packages that other paid users have given you write access to

## Scopes

All private packages are scoped. Your paid access applies to your scope, which is your username with an `@` in front.

`@username/project-name`

Read more about [scopes](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/scoped-packages).

## Access

The access page gives you control over access to your package. To get to it, go to your package page at `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@username/your-package/access`, or click on the Collaborators link on the package page.

### Making a package private

All scoped packages default to restricted access. This ensures that you don't make something public by accident. You can change this on the access page.

You can also change package access via the command line using `npm access restricted <package_name>`.

The package will be removed from listings on the site within a few minutes of making it private.

### Adding collaborators to a project

You can add collaborators to your project.

You can also use `npm owner add <user> <package name>`.

When you add a collaborator to a private package through the web site, the collaborator will be given read-only access. If you add a collaborator to a private package via the command line, the collaborator will be given read-write access. Collaborators will also have read-write access for any non-private packages.

### Changing collaborator access

If you want to give a user write access, change their access on the package page by clicking on `read-write`. You can also remove collaborators by clicking on the X.

## Logging in

When you try to install a package from the CLI, you might get an access error. You will need to run `npm login` once to update your `~/.npmrc` file before working with private packages.

## Organizations

Currently, private packages are only available for individual users, but support for organization accounts is coming soon. Feel free to create a user for your organization in the meantime, and we can upgrade it to an organization when support is here.
